# Experimental_Tools
Miscellaneous functions for experimental design (e.g. counterbalancing and condition permutations) and also functions for behavioral task analysis (e.g. signal detection measures)
Currently includes: 
1) SDT_measures.m 
  - Generates signal detection measures for memory task. 
2) GenSequence2.m
  - Generate sequence for item presentation based on criterion for repetition intervals (i.e. How many intervening items before repetition of specific condition)
3) GenSequence3.m
  - Generate sequence for item presentation based on criterion for how many consecutive repetition is allowed (i.e. How many times a condition can be repeated consecutively)
